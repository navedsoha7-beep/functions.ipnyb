        "\n",

        "\n",
        "   -Generators in Python:\n",
        "\n",
        "Generators are a simple and powerful tool for creating iterators. They are functions that use the yield keyword instead of return to produce a sequence of values. When a generator function is called, it doesn't execute the code immediately. Instead, it returns a generator object, which is an iterator.\n",
        "\n",
        "How they are defined:\n",
        "\n",
        "Generators are defined like regular functions, but they use the yield keyword at least once. When yield is encountered, the function's state is saved, and the yielded value is returned. The next time the generator's __next__ method is called (e.g., in a for loop), the function resumes execution from where it left off, with all its local variables and state restored.\n",
        "\n",
        "Key characteristics of generators:\n",
        "\n",
        "Memory efficient: They generate values on the fly, one at a time, rather than creating the entire sequence in memory at once. This is especially useful for large datasets or infinite sequences.\n",
        "Lazy evaluation: Values are only produced when requested (when __next__ is called).\n",
        "Easy to implement: They are often simpler to write than traditional iterators using classes.\n",
        "Example:\n",
        "\n",
        "Consider the powers_of_two generator function we created earlier:\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "7. What are the advantages of using generators over regular functions?\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "     -Memory Efficiency: This is perhaps the most significant advantage. Regular functions that return lists or other sequences create the entire sequence in memory at once. For large datasets, this can consume a lot of memory and even lead to MemoryError. Generators, on the other hand, generate values on the fly, yielding one item at a time. They only keep track of their state between yield calls, making them highly memory efficient.\n",
        "\n",
        "Lazy Evaluation: Generators produce values only when they are requested (e.g., by a for loop or the next() function). This \"lazy\" evaluation is beneficial when you only need to process a few items from a potentially large sequence or when dealing with infinite sequences. Regular functions compute all values upfront.\n",
        "\n",
        "Improved Performance for Large Datasets: Due to their memory efficiency and lazy evaluation, generators can be faster than regular functions for processing large datasets, as they avoid the overhead of creating and storing the entire sequence in memory.\n",
        "\n",
        "Simpler Code for Iterators: Writing custom iterators using classes can be complex, requiring the implementation of __iter__ and __next__ methods and handling StopIteration. Generators provide a much simpler and more concise way to create iterators using the yield keyword.\n",
        "\n",
        "Handling Infinite Sequences: Generators can easily produce infinite sequences of data because they don't need to store the entire sequence in memory. Regular functions would struggle with this.\n",
        "\n",
        "Pipelining Operations: Generators can be chained together to create data processing pipelines. Each generator in the pipeline can perform a specific transformation on the data, and the data flows through the pipeline one item at a time, which is memory efficient.\n",
        "\n",
        "In summary, generators are particularly useful when you need to work with large datasets, perform lazy evaluation, or create custom iterators in a simple and memory-efficient way.\n",
